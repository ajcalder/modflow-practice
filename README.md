# mar_vineyards_modflow
_Andrew Calderwood_  
GitHub repository to store MODFLOW model variations on the lower Cosumnes River and to share modeling efforts. The first folder in this repository is Basic_Cosumnes which is a simplified model of the study area to set up the model grid and DEM. Further additions of packages will be built on in subfolders or perhaps through different branches.
The repository will be built into two primary models: one with an analytical for streambed seepage and one with a numerical solution for streambed seepage. Those two models may be then broken up into a fine and coarse mesh grid variations to test whether grid resolution affects the solution for either method.
